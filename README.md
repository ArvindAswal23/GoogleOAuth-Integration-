# GoogleOAuth-Integration-
Integrate Google oAuth API in your Web app
Google APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. 
Google supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios such as those for web server, client-side, installed, and limited-input device applications.
To begin, obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the Google API Console. 
To create a Google Sign-In button with custom settings, 
add an element to contain the sign-in button to your sign-in page,
write a function that calls signin2.render() with your style and scope settings, 
and include the https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js script with the query string onload=YOUR_RENDER_FUNCTION.
